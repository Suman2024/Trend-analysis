# Call Center Data Analysis Project
# Overview
This project analyzes a dataset from a call center to identify trends, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. The analysis focuses on call duration, waiting times, customer feedback, and agent performance using various data analytics techniques.

# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Understand call patterns (peak hours, call duration, call volume).
Evaluate agent performance based on key metrics like call handling time, customer satisfaction ratings, etc.
Identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies within the call center operation.
Provide actionable insights to improve customer experience and call center efficiency.
 Overall customer satisfaction
 
 Overall calls answered/abandoned
 
 Calls by time
 
Average speed of answer

Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

# Tools and Technology
Data Handling: SQL
Reporting: Power BI 
# Data
